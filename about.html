    <h2>🌿 About HerbaWash</h2>
    <p>WHerbaWash is more than just a skincare brand — it's a heartfelt movement rooted in nature, tradition, and trust. Born from a deep desire to eliminate harmful chemicals from everyday skincare routines, HerbaWash was founded with a single mission: to offer pure, affordable, and effective herbal alternatives that nourish your skin without compromise.

We believe that what you put on your body should be as safe and natural as what you put into it. Every product we craft is handmade with care, using time-tested Ayurvedic ingredients like neem, turmeric, honey, charcoal, aloe vera, kuppaimeni, and many more — each chosen for their healing, soothing, and beautifying properties. Whether it's our charcoal detox soap, beetroot lip balm, or butter-based moisturizer, every product reflects our commitment to gentle yet powerful skincare.

At HerbaWash, transparency and ethics are non-negotiable. We proudly say no to parabens, sulfates, synthetic dyes, and artificial fragrances. Instead, we embrace eco-friendly packaging, cruelty-free practices, and clearly listed ingredients so you always know what’s touching your skin.

Founded by a passionate student entrepreneur, HerbaWash caters especially to young individuals looking for natural, affordable, and honest skincare. Our journey began with a simple realization: skincare should not hurt your skin, your health, or the planet. With that vision, we set out to create a line of skincare products that are:

🌱 100% Natural and Herbal

💧 Safe for All Skin Types, Especially Sensitive Skin

♻️ Eco-Conscious and Sustainable

🛍️ Student-Friendly and Budget-Conscious

As we grow, we remain grounded in our values — to heal, to simplify, and to empower. Whether you're battling acne, dryness, dullness, or simply want to glow naturally, HerbaWash has a clean, green solution for you.

Welcome to HerbaWash — where beauty begins with honesty and nature leads the way</p>
